          Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and
          father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to
          the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek
          kappa-rho ligature with a horizontal stroke, as an abbreviation for
          Κρονος (Cronus), the Greek name for the planet . It later came to look
          like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the
          16th century to Christianize this pagan symbol. The Romans named the
          seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day"), for
          the planet Saturn.

          Saturn has 146 known moons, 63 of which have formal names. It is
          estimated that there are other 100±30 outer irregular moons larger
          than 3 km (2 mi) in diameter. In addition, there is evidence of dozens
          to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40–500 meters in Saturn's
          rings,which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest
          moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn,
          including the rings.Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a
          tenuous ring system of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.
