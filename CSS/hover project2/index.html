                Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture
                and father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been
                traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be
                seen to be a Greek kappa-rho ligature with a horizontal stroke,
                as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronus), the Greek name for the
                planet . It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with
                the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize
                this pagan symbol. The Romans named the seventh day of the week
                Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day"), for the planet Saturn.

                Saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and
                helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have
                a solid core.Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an
                oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and
                bulges at its equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10%
                larger than its polar radius: 60,268 km versus 54,364 km.
                Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the
                Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The
                combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the
                effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96 m/s2, is 74%
                of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity
                of Earth.

                Saturn has 146 known moons, 63 of which have formal names. It is
                estimated that there are other 100±30 outer irregular moons
                larger than 3 km (2 mi) in diameter. In addition, there is
                evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of
                40–500 meters in Saturn's rings,which are not considered to be
                true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of
                the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings.Saturn's
                second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its
                own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.
