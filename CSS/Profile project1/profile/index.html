          Williams was born at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois,[16] on
          July 21, 1951.[17] His father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams (1906-1987),
          was a senior executive in Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division.[18][19] His
          mother, Laurie McLaurin (1922-2001), was a former model from Jackson,
          Mississippi, whose great-grandfather was Mississippi senator and
          governor Anselm J. McLaurin.[20] Williams had two older half-brothers:
          a paternal half-brother, Robert (also known as Todd),[21] and a
          maternal half-brother, McLaurin.[22] While his mother was a
          practitioner of Christian Science, Williams was raised in his father's
          Episcopal faith.[23][24] During a television interview on Inside the
          Actors Studio in 2001, Williams credited his mother as an important
          early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain
          attention.

          Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay
          Area in 1976.[44] He gave his first performance at the Holy City Zoo,
          a comedy club in San Francisco, where he worked his way up from
          tending bar.[45] In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a rock
          music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the
          late 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance", writes
          critic Gerald Nachman. Williams says he found out about "drugs and
          happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of
          my time turned to mud
