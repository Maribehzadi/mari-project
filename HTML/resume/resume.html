<dt>Early life</dt><br>
<dd>John Christopher Depp II was born on June 9, 1963, in<b style="color: purple;">Owensboro, Kentucky,sthe youngest</b> of four children of waitress Betty Sue Depp <b style="background-color: brown;">(n√©e Wells; later Palmer)</b> and civil engineer John Christopher Depp. Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970. His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called <i style="color: blue;">"an inspiration"</i></dd><br><hr>

<dt>Career</dt>
<dd style="background-color: aqua;">Depp moved to Los Angeles with his band when he was 20. After the band split up, Depp's then-wife Lori Ann Allison introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage.<b style="background-color: palevioletred;"> After they became drinking buddies, Cage advised him to pursue acting.</b> Depp had been interested in acting since reading a biography of James Dean and watching Rebel Without a Cause. Cage helped Depp get an audition with Wes Craven for A Nightmare on Elm Street; Depp, who had no acting experience, said he <ins style="color: black;">"ended up acting by accident"</ins>.Thanks in part to his catching the eye of Craven's daughter, Depp landed the role of the main character's boyfriend, one of Freddy Krueger's victims.</dd><br><hr>
